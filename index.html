    <h3>India(2011)</h3>
    <img src="India.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300">
    <p>In the first report from Madhya Pradesh as reported in the Daily Bhaskar, which has since     been unavailable, a six-year-old boy was bitten by a rabid dog in January. The dog reportedly died the next day and according to family members, the 6-year-old boy developed rabies and bit 5 of them before his death in June. In a second unusual and related account, the Times of India reports in Ludhiana, a person that was “bitten by a street dog” got rabid and started running after other patients to bite them at the Civil Hospital, where he was undergoing treatment. Says Dr Avinash Jindal, specialist physician who treated the patient Gurdiyal Singh at Civil Hospital: “The patient was brought to our hospital yesterday (Friday) in the emergency after he got aggressive. He was first checked by the psychiatrist as he reported of severe aggression symptoms. This morning, while we were checking him, he got more aggressive and started running after people there. He, in fact, bit a 25-year-old patient at the hospital. When I took his history, his attendant told me that he was bitten by a stray dog about 10 days ago. Suspecting him to be suffering from hydrophobia, we did a simple test and brought water in front of the patient. He got convulsions and suffered from laryngeal spasms, thus confirming that he indeed is suffering from rabies. I later gave him antibiotics and</p>
    <p>anti-convalescents.”   These two accounts of humans with reported rabies getting aggressive and attacking is clearly unusual. As a moderator for the infectious disease website, ProMED-mail notes: Both reports describe victims exhibiting rabies-like symptoms following a dog bite and in turn transmitting rabies by bite to other human victims. Neither incident has been corroborated independently. Likewise, rabies virus infection has not been confirmed by laboratory diagnostics in the case of either of the dogs responsible for the initial bites, or the initial human victims, or the hospitalised patients reputed to have been bitten by the supposedly rabid humans. Transmission of rabies from one human to another by bite, although not impossible, is unlikely, and, according to the US CDC, has not happened (http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/transmission/exposure.html). According to the World Health Organization, Rabies is a zoonotic disease (a disease that is transmitted to humans from animals) that is caused by a virus. The disease affects domestic and wild animals, and is spread to people through close contact with infectious material, usually saliva, via bites or scratches.</p>

    <h3>Miami cannibal attack</h3>
    <img src="Miami.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300">
    <p>The Miami cannibal attack occurred on May 26, 2012, when assailant Rudy Eugene was fatally shot as he assaulted Ronald Poppo on the MacArthur Causeway in Miami, Florida. During the 18-minute filmed encounter, Eugene (who had stripped himself nude) beat Poppo unconscious, removed his pants, and chewed off most of his face above the beard, including his left eye. As a result of the incident's shocking nature and subsequent worldwide media coverage, Eugene came to be dubbed the "Miami Zombie" as well as the "Causeway Cannibal".</p>
    <p>Although friends and family have filled in details of Eugene's life, the motive remains unknown. It is not believed that the two men knew each other. Eugene, 31, employed at a car wash at the time of the attack, was a divorced former high school football player with a series of petty criminal arrests from age 16 until most recently in 2009. Poppo, 65, was homeless and had long been presumed dead by his estranged family.</p>
    <p>Police sources have said they believe that use of a street drug like "bath salts" may have been a factor, but this is pure speculation and toxicology reports are pending.</p>

    <h3>24th, November 2012 A.D., Chicago</h3>
    <img src="Zumbis2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300">
    <p>On Thanksgiving, an enraged man was aboard the California bus on Chicago’s south side. He was intoxicated, and taking off his clothes as he beat and assaulted several passengers, including the bus driver. The first officer on the scene was an evidence technician. He approached the bus as the assailant, Ismael Jamison, 28, began to attack the officer. The officer shot the crazed attacker, who then stumbled backward. He regained his footing and again approached the officer, who quickly shot again. When more officers and medics arrived on the scene, Jamison needed to be tasered to be subdued enough to be placed in the ambulance. Shot twice, naked, tasered, and randomly attacking civilians and officers. Highly suspicious behavior. Bath salts? Wasted on booze? Or perhaps something more potent, perhaps he was rabid.</p>

    <p>A 'zombie' is the term associated with a person (often, but not always infected by a virus of some sort), that possesses the brain and shuts down the internal systems of the victim, basically transforming them into one of the walking dead. After this mutation occurs, the victim is no longer a person, but instead a mindless shambling corpse with an insatiable hunger for flesh. In contemporary versions, these are generally reanimated or undead corpses. Stories of zombies are as old as the human race, with mentions of them in the oldest known work of literature, the Epic of Gilgamesh. Furthermore, Zombies can't be thought of as the existence of life (or at least animation) after death because then people will think they won't hurt anyone.

Other, more macabre versions of zombies have become a staple of modern horror fiction, where they are brought back from the dead by supernatural or scientific means, and eat the flesh of the living. They have very limited intelligence, and may not be under anyone's direct control. This type of zombie, often referred to as a Romero zombie for the filmmaker that defined the concept, is archetypal in modern media and culture.

Rarely, Zombies can also be animals, though this is scarcely recognized by Zombie enthusiasts. It is unknown which particular animals are susceptible to the disease, or if they are at risk at all.

Most Zombies can be found roaming around their places of death in search of living organisms to feed on. The zombies will walk around, searching for food until it locates a living being, at which point it will raise its arms and form a guttural moaning deep in its throat, attracting other zombies in the area.

In a first world country, most people showing symptoms of infection (fever, disorientation) will be brought to the closest hospital. After a few hours, depending on the severity of the infection, the infected will die and then reanimate into a fully developed zombie.

Contrary to popular belief, a graveyard is usually a safe haven from zombies. It takes a few hours at most from "death" to reanimation and as it takes a few days at the very least for a burial to be organized, there have been no reports of a zombie reanimating in a coffin. In fact, zombies tend to avoid graveyards as it is simply wide stretches of abandoned land. Even if a zombie did reanimate here, the only danger would be if it reanimated during the burial. It would most likely animate in the coffin where, to get out, it would have to claw through a foot of steel and six feet of <dirt class=""></dirt></p>
